## Final Project

### Project Summary

Our final project will focus on festivals, specifically festivals held in the U.S. The reason for us choosing this topic is because we find Midwest celebrations interesting and want to highlight just how great they truly are! The 4 of us, Kiersten, Elias, Haven, and myself will be working together in order to display a wide range of festivals. We will use CRUD techniques with a sqlite database in order for user's to have an interactive experience. As of right now, some of our main page flow will take the user on a journey throughout specific festivals and by the end of that experience hopefully, learn about midwest festivals and also maybe purchase tickets of these festivals!

### Key Takeaways

Understanding of why we are doing this project

### Core Webpages

Login/Signup: This page will be for users who either A. have an account, or B. need to signup. This will also be the first page that shows and will also show if a user chooses to logout. 

Joseph Roper Lollapalooza: 
1. For my first page I will walk through Lollapalooza. I will describe what it is, give an overview, and possibly this year's artists involved! There will be pictures for user's too look at as well as videos (if I get that working.) 
2. For my second page this is where my user's will be able to interact with the webpage. Specifically, this will have the CRUD features. 
    Features include:
    - Create a schedule for a trip and view that schedule. (Create and Read)
    - Purchase tickets (simulated database) (Delete)
    - Change any scheduling in order to get the best Lolla experience (Update)
