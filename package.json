  "description": "Our final project will focus on festivals, specifically festivals held in the U.S. The reason for us choosing this topic is because we find Midwest celebrations interesting and want to highlight just how great they truly are! The 4 of us, Kiersten, Elias, Haven, and myself will be working together in order to display a wide range of festivals. We will use CRUD techniques with a sqlite database in order for user's to have an interactive experience. As of right now, some of our main page flow will take the user on a journey throughout specific festivals and by the end of that experience hopefully, learn about midwest festivals and also maybe purchase tickets of these festivals!",
